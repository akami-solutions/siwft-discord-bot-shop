# Welcome Developers!

As many of you already know from following our projects, SIWFT is owned and maintained by Akami Solutions.

In order to enhance user experience and to simplify many processes, I decided to code a Discord bot template that uses the basics of the SIWFT API. As always, our aim is to make the code as performant, readable, and secure as possible to save resources and improve the bot's response times.

There might be certain aspects that are not as performant or clearly coded in the early updates, but they will adapt over time.

## Bot Language

I'm planning to code the bot in different languages. However, we are going to release and start each language one after the other, and we will start with Node.js using Discord.JS.

Here is a list of planned programming languages:

| Programming Language | Library     | Status         |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| CSharp, DotNet       | Discord.NET | Planned        |
| JavaScript, NodeJS   | Discord.JS  | In Development |
| Java                 | JDA         | Planned        |
| PHP                  | Discord.php | Planned        |
| Rust                 | /           | Not planned    |
| Go                   | /           | Not planned    |

## Why Discord.JS?

Some of you may be wondering why we specifically chose Discord.JS and the answer is quite simple. Discord.JS is known for its large user base and in many cases, easy implementation. We might switch libraries over time, if I come to the conclusion that another one offers better performance or other benefits.

## Docker Support?

Just like in my other projects, Docker support is also possible here. However, this will be added and extended later on, as its benefits are not quite significant at the current stage.
